                    Understanding the influences of Christianity in the villages of Katkahi parish

                    The tribals of Jharkhand have been influenced by a lot of factors in terms of culture, social and 
                    political nature. One of those factors was the adoption Christianity that began around a hundred years ago and is speculated to have affected the community both positively and negatively.

                <p class="normal-text">Christianity started around a hundred years ago in the Chota-Nagpur plateau region of which the parish of Katkahi is a part of and comes under the district of Gumla, Jharkhand. The area is occupied by the tribal population and Gumla is reported to have the highest proportion of Schedule Tribes (68.4%) in the State. 

                    Over the years, several factors have influenced the tribal community culturally, socially and politically. Christianity has been one of those factors and is said to have brought education and development in tribal societies. The missionaries were also known to help the tribals with the legal help required during the period of exploitation after the land acquisition act of 1894.
                    On the other side, adoption of a new religion has also lead to discrimination against the tribal population. Cases of social mobilization and legal cases whereby attempts have been made to deschedule Christian tribes from scheduled tribe status have come up. 
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    </p>
                <p class="normal-text">
                    Looking through the lens of data allows us to review the influence of Christianity in the region. The trends in adoption of Christianity in different villages and combining it with other relevant data, particularly the availability of amenities such as education and medical facilities, can through light upon the speculations put forth when it comes to positive or negative influences of Christianity in the tribal areas of Jharkhand.

                    Christianity has been among the tribals of Jharkhand for about over a hundred years from now and has been affecting the society in several forms. The first records could be found as early as 1872, but the 
                    most number of baptisms happened between 19281936, with initial adopters of Christianity found in relatively larger villages.  Political agendas would always act as a driving force for the course of 
                    actions in any state but in a secular country, one must not be discriminated against on the grounds of religion. The events tell us how, after the Land Acquisition Act, the rise in baptism was witnessed 
                    and as the activities by the missionaries increase, the number of baptisms also increase. It could also be seen that at the peak, not many activities could be found. As far as availability of 
                    amenities is concerned, one interesting point was that the village with the most number of baptism didn’t have any school. There also seemed to be a correlation between the number of baptisms and the number 
                    of the schools established in that year. The co-relation between medical facilities and number of baptism could not be witnessed. Though no causality can be established due to the insufficient data in hand, 
                    some interesting insights lead to curiosity about the subject. Instances such as the villages not found and the schools not counted in the census raise important questions about the access of such villages to the 
                    government officials or just shear impartiality. </p>
